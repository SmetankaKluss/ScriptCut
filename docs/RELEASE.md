# ScriptCut Release Guide

This guide is for preparing a desktop release from the repository.

## Current Release Status

ScriptCut has a draft alpha desktop release path. Source development is still supported with:

```bash
npm run setup
npm run doctor
npm run dev
```

That starts the local backend, frontend, and Electron desktop app.

## Release Checklist

Run these checks before creating a release:

```bash
npm run doctor
npm run release:ffmpeg
npm run lint
npm run build:frontend
npm run smoke:backend
python -m compileall -q backend
```

For a fuller desktop gate, run:

```bash
npm run qa:desktop
```

When packaging changes are included, run:

```bash
npm run qa:desktop:package
```

Check app identity, icon, signing, and notarization readiness:

```bash
npm run release:trust
```

Use strict mode on the machine that will publish the final public release:

```bash
npm run release:trust -- --strict
```

Then verify the creator workflow manually:

- Open the Electron desktop app with `npm run dev`.
- Open a local video file.
- Transcribe with the selected engine.
- Delete a few words and preview edited playback.
- Export a source-frame MP4.
- Export a vertical shorts MP4 with captions. Confirm the setup check and release manifest agree on whether captions are burned in or delivered as a sidecar `.srt` file.
- Create at least one clip draft and export it.
- Save a `.scriptcut` project and reopen it.

Use the detailed checklist in [Desktop QA](./DESKTOP_QA.md) for release candidates.

## macOS DMG Build

Prepare a local alpha release package:

```bash
npm run release:alpha
```

That command runs release trust checks, prepares portable FFmpeg/FFprobe and the standalone backend runtime, runs desktop package QA, builds the macOS DMG, writes `dist/release-alpha/SHA256SUMS.txt`, writes `dist/release-alpha/release-manifest.json`, and writes `dist/release-alpha/RELEASE_NOTES.md`.

By default the package is prepared for `v0.1.0-alpha`. For follow-up alpha builds under the same app version, pass a more specific tag:

```bash
RELEASE_TAG=v0.1.0-alpha.1 npm run release:alpha
```

The release script only creates a DMG for the architecture of the Mac preparing it. Verify the matching FFmpeg bundle before packaging:

```bash
npm run release:platform
```

On an Apple Silicon Mac this produces and verifies an arm64 DMG. An Intel build must be prepared and verified on a native Intel Mac with its own FFmpeg bundle; do not cross-package an unverified target.

The command also runs `npm run release:trust`. Missing signing or notarization credentials are warnings for local alpha drafts, but should be resolved before publishing broadly.

When no Developer ID credentials are configured, the alpha release flow deliberately disables Electron Builder's automatic certificate discovery. This prevents a random local Apple Development certificate from producing an inconsistent build. The resulting alpha is unsigned and is not a notarized public macOS release.

Build a local macOS DMG:

```bash
npm run dist:mac
```

The generated installer will be written under `dist/`.

Use `npm run dist:dir` when you only need an unpacked app bundle for local QA.

## Windows NSIS and Portable Build

Build Windows releases only on native Windows x64:

```powershell
npm run release:windows
```

The command downloads a checksum-verified static FFmpeg build, creates the
standalone PyInstaller backend, runs desktop QA, builds NSIS and portable
executables, starts the packaged backend, and renders a real vertical clip with
ASS captions and a censorship bleep. It then launches the packaged
`ScriptCut.exe` and confirms that its protected local backend starts. It writes
checksums and a release manifest to `dist/release-windows/`.

The same path is available through the `package_windows` workflow-dispatch
input. CI uploads `.exe` files only after native verification succeeds.

To promote an already verified Actions artifact, dispatch
`publish-windows-alpha.yml` with its successful CI run ID. The workflow derives
the version and default prerelease tag from `package.json`; an explicit tag is
optional. It revalidates `SHA256SUMS.txt`, normalizes the public asset names,
regenerates the matching public manifest/checksum file, and only then uploads
the release assets.

## GitHub Release Draft

Use this format for the first public alpha release:

Title:

```text
ScriptCut v0.1.0-alpha
```

Description:

```text
ScriptCut is an open-source, local-first desktop video editor for creators.

Highlights:
- Edit video by editing transcript text
- Export source, square, and vertical shorts clips
- Burn in creator captions when the bundled FFmpeg supports ASS subtitles; otherwise export a matching `.srt` caption file
- Package clip titles, captions, descriptions, hashtags, and hook frames
- Use optional AI helpers while keeping media local

Install:
1. Download the macOS Apple Silicon (arm64) DMG attached to this release.
2. Open ScriptCut.
3. Run the first-launch checks and follow any dependency prompts.

Status:
This is an alpha build. Keep original media and project backups.
```

Attach:

- macOS `.dmg`
- `dist/release-alpha/SHA256SUMS.txt`
- `dist/release-alpha/release-manifest.json`
- short demo video or screenshot, when available

After `npm run release:alpha`, the script prints a `gh release create ... --draft` command using the active release tag. Review the generated release notes before publishing.

Publish a verified public alpha as the repository's latest release, even though its title includes `alpha`. ScriptCut's in-app and README download links use `/releases/latest`; leave the alpha warning in the title and release notes rather than marking the release as a GitHub prerelease.

## Signing And Notarization

The alpha release flow can prepare a draft DMG without Apple credentials, but public macOS distribution should be signed and notarized.

Run:

```bash
npm run release:trust
```

Expected alpha-draft results:

- App icon and package metadata should be `OK`.
- Developer ID, signing certificate, and notarization entries may be `WARN` on machines without Apple Developer credentials.

Expected public-release results:

```bash
npm run release:trust -- --strict
```

Strict mode should pass on the release machine before publishing broadly.

Supported signing inputs:

- `CSC_LINK` and `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` for a certificate file.
- `CSC_NAME` when the certificate is already installed in the signing keychain.

Supported notarization inputs:

- `APPLE_API_KEY`, `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`, and `APPLE_API_ISSUER`.
- Or `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, and `APPLE_TEAM_ID`.

## Notes

- Python 3.11 is the recommended runtime for local development.
- Current desktop alphas bundle FFmpeg/FFprobe and the standalone backend runtime. Python 3.11 remains the recommended runtime for source development and maintainer builds.
- `npm run release:ffmpeg` verifies that FFmpeg/FFprobe execute from the release bundle and packages non-system macOS dylibs. Do not manually copy host FFmpeg executables into a release.
- The bundle manifest records whether the selected FFmpeg supports ASS burn-in captions. Releases without that filter use the tested sidecar `.srt` fallback and must state that in their notes.
- Parakeet TDT v3 requires optional NVIDIA NeMo ASR dependencies.
- Browser mode at `localhost:5173` is for development. The desktop app is the intended user version.
- Public macOS releases should be signed and notarized with Apple Developer credentials.
