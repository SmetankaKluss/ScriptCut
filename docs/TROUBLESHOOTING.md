# Troubleshooting

Run this first:

```bash
npm run doctor
```

## Python Not Found

Use Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12. Python 3.11 is recommended.

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

To force a specific interpreter:

```bash
export SCRIPTCUT_PYTHON_PATH=/absolute/path/to/python
```

## FFmpeg Missing

If you installed ScriptCut from a desktop release, use the first-run checks or update to the latest release. Release builds are prepared with bundled FFmpeg for export.

If you run ScriptCut from source, install FFmpeg and ensure it is available in `PATH`:

```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

Release maintainers can also prepare the local bundle before packaging:

```bash
npm run release:ffmpeg
```

On a native Windows release machine use:

```powershell
npm run release:ffmpeg:windows
```

This path rejects unverified downloads and requires ASS subtitle support.

## Backend Will Not Start

Run:

```bash
npm run dev:backend
```

Then check:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8642/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{"status":"ok"}
```

## AI Features Do Not Work

Local AI features require Ollama to be running, or a configured cloud provider key in Settings.

```bash
ollama list
```

Cloud providers require valid API keys. ScriptCut keeps provider settings local.

## Background Removal Is Disabled

Background removal requires optional Python packages such as MediaPipe and OpenCV. Check availability in the export panel or by running:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8642/background/capabilities
```
